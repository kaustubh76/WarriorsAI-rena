## MAIN THREAD (15 Tweets)

---

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
Introducing Warriors AI Arena

The first AI-powered battle game on @0aboratory mainnet.

Your warriors don't fight with luck. They fight with intelligence.

Here's everything you need to know
```

---

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)
```
Most NFT games are glorified slot machines.

You mint. You click "battle." RNG decides the winner.

No strategy. No skill. Just luck.

We built something different.
```

---

### Tweet 3 (The Solution)
```
In Warriors AI Arena, every warrior has an AI brain.

Each battle, the AI:
- Analyzes the opponent
- Considers its personality
- Chooses optimal moves
- Adapts its strategy

5 rounds. 5 decisions. Real intelligence.
```

---

### Tweet 4 (How It Works)
```
How battles work:

1. Two warriors enter the arena
2. Players bet on who wins
3. AI agents control each warrior
4. 5 rounds of strategic combat
5. Lowest damage taken wins

Every move is signed cryptographically and verified on-chain.
```

---

### Tweet 5 (The Moves)
```
Every warrior has 5 moves:

STRIKE - Raw damage
TAUNT - Psychological warfare
DODGE - Evade attacks
SPECIAL - Maximum power
RECOVER - Heal damage

The AI chooses based on your warrior's unique personality.
```

---

### Tweet 6 (Traits)
```
What makes your warrior unique?

5 traits shape their AI personality:

Strength - Hit harder
Wit - Outsmart opponents
Charisma - Manipulate the battlefield
Defence - Take less damage
Luck - Land critical hits

No two warriors fight the same.
```

---

### Tweet 7 (Player Agency)
```
But you're not just watching.

During battles, YOU can:

INFLUENCE - Boost your warrior's damage
DEFLUENCE - Weaken your opponent
BET - Stake tokens on the outcome

Your decisions matter. Your strategy matters.
```

---

### Tweet 8 (Dynamic NFTs)
```
Your warrior evolves.

Win battles. Earn rankings.

UNRANKED → BRONZE → SILVER → GOLD → PLATINUM

Higher ranks = bigger arenas = larger rewards

Your warrior's journey is permanent. On-chain. Forever.
```

---

### Tweet 9 (Tokenomics)
```
The economy is simple:

Crown Token (CRwN)
- 1:1 backed by FLOW
- Bet on battles
- Influence outcomes
- Burned when spent

No inflation. No rug. Just gameplay.
```

---

### Tweet 10 (Why 0G)
```
Why we built on @0GLabs:

Decentralized AI compute - No central servers
Encrypted storage - Your data, protected
Fast & cheap - Gaming needs speed
EVM compatible - Easy onboarding

0G is the perfect home for AI gaming.
```

---

```
Under the hood:

- 4 smart contracts (1,980 lines of Solidity)
- 0G AI agents for battle decisions
- ECDSA verification for every move
