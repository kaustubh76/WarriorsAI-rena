## 2. Problem/Solution Section

### Section Title
```
NFT Gaming is Broken. We Fixed It.
```

### Problem Cards

**Card 1: RNG Combat**

Most NFT games use random number generation.
Click battle. Hope for the best.
No strategy. No skill. Just luck.
```

Traditional NFTs are frozen in time.
Win 1,000 battles? Still looks the same.
No growth. No progression.

💸 The Problem: Wallet Wins

Rare NFT = guaranteed victory.
Strategy doesn't matter.
Just buy your way to the top.
```

## 8. FAQ Section

### Section Title
```
Frequently Asked Questions
```

### General FAQs

**Q: What is Warriors AI Arena?**
```
Warriors AI Arena is an AI-powered battle game where NFT warriors
fight autonomously using artificial intelligence. Each warrior has
unique traits that shape their AI personality and fighting style.
All battles are verified on-chain on 0G Network.
```

**Q: How is this different from other NFT games?**
```
Unlike games that use random number generation (RNG), our battles
are decided by AI agents that analyze traits and make strategic
decisions. Your warrior's personality affects how it fights—not
just its stats. Plus, everything is verifiable on-chain.
```

**Q: Is this pay-to-win?**
```
No. Strategy matters more than spending. A well-timed Influence
can turn a battle. High-rank warriors aren't guaranteed to win
against smart opponents. Skill and timing beat wallet size.
```

### Minting FAQs

**Q: How much does it cost to mint?**
```
Minting is FREE—you only pay gas fees on 0G Network.
Each mint gives you a unique warrior with AI-generated traits.
```

**Q: Can I choose my warrior's traits?**
```
No. Traits are generated by AI during the activation ceremony.
This ensures fairness and creates unique warriors. Your warrior's
personality emerges from the combination of traits it receives.
```

**Q: How many warriors can I mint?**
```
There's no limit per wallet. However, each warrior requires
individual attention in battles, so most players focus on
developing 1-3 warriors.
```

### Battle FAQs

**Q: How do battles work?**
```
Two warriors enter an arena. Over 5 rounds, AI agents select
moves (STRIKE, TAUNT, DODGE, SPECIAL, RECOVER) based on each
warrior's personality and the battle state. The warrior with
the lowest total damage at the end wins.
```

**Q: Can I control my warrior during battle?**
```
The AI controls combat moves, but YOU can influence the battle:
- INFLUENCE: Spend CRwN to boost damage
- DEFLUENCE: Spend CRwN to weaken opponent (once per battle)
- BET: Wager on the outcome
```

**Q: What happens if I lose?**
```
Your warrior doesn't "die"—they can battle again immediately.
However, you lose any CRwN you bet on the battle. Rankings are
based on cumulative winnings, not win/loss record alone.
```

### Token FAQs

**Q: What is Crown Token (CRwN)?**
```
CRwN is the in-game currency for betting and influence actions.
It's 1:1 backed by FLOW—deposit FLOW to mint CRwN, burn CRwN
to receive FLOW back. No complex tokenomics, just utility.
```

**Q: Is CRwN an investment?**
```
No. CRwN is a utility token for gameplay. Its value is tied 1:1
to FLOW. It's not designed for speculation—it's designed for
playing the game.
```

**Q: Where does the betting money go?**
```
95% goes to winning bettors (split equally)
5% goes to the warrior's creator
0% is kept by the platform beyond gas
```

### Technical FAQs

**Q: What blockchain is this on?**
```
Warriors AI Arena runs on 0G Network, leveraging:
- 0G Compute for AI processing
- 0G Storage for encrypted metadata
- 0G's EVM compatibility for smart contracts
```

**Q: How can I verify battle results?**
```
Every battle is recorded on-chain. You can view the transaction
hash, see the moves each warrior made, and verify the outcome.
All AI decisions are cryptographically signed.
```

**Q: Is the AI centralized?**
```
AI computation runs on 0G's decentralized compute network.
The AI model itself is deterministic—given the same inputs,
it produces the same outputs, ensuring verifiability.
